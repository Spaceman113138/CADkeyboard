# Overview

## Goal
Make a numpad like keyboard for common CAD shortcuts so hands do not have to move between the mouse and keyboard because shortcuts are often far apart requiring hand movement

## Requirements
### Necesity
- Enough Keys for all commonly used CAD shortcuts
    - Needs to be defined further after more research
- Able to have key mapping change to different shortcuts
    - should have basic presets for different CAD programs
- Small enough to fit on desk next to laptop
- Comfortabe to use

### Nice to have
- Group similar shortcuts together
- Looks nice
- Has digits 0-9 and decimal

# Journaling

### May 24
- Created my goal and started writing requirements
- Decided what shortcuts are needed for sketching
    - 6 line creation shortcuts
    - 6 line adjustment shortucts
    - 6 constraint shortcuts
    - alt, shift, esc required regardless
- I need to decide how to simplify because 21 keys is likely to many and this is before considering part-studio + assembly shortcuts
- I also started skimming through some pre-existing keyboard desgins on google and extended numpad or ergonomic style half keyboard designs seem promising but I need to nail down requirements before starting design.
